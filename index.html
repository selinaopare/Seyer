    <p class="leading-relaxed">
      I’m Selina Opare—a poet, writer, voiceover artist, and spoken word performer who transforms raw emotion into art.
      I weave honesty, faith, and storytelling into pieces that speak to the soul and linger long after they’re heard.

      Through heartfelt performances, commissioned poems, and personal writing projects, I give voice to the moments people often struggle to express.
      Beyond my creative work, I’m a student at KNUST, studying English, where my love for language and expression continues to grow.

      My art is my way of making meaning out of emotion—and sharing that meaning with others.

          All I saw was black. Pure black. There was nothing it lacked.    
          It had its spark, the black kind, while everything perfectly aligned.    
          It was filled with gloom, it spelt doom like a bullet in a womb.    
          And a dead man without a tomb ha!    
          Just pure black.    
          The kind of black that screamed "hark!"    
          The kind that barks then cuts you some slack, that black.    
          The kind that does not go behind your back to show your cracks.    
          That black I saw.    
          When I slipped into a peaceful quiet.    
          I saw it. It saw me. And we smiled.<br><br>

    In some other world, with a road untarred<br><br>

    My mind wallows tentatively to the old days<br>
    I don't try to fight it, I don't try to stop it<br>
    I just let it swim back, to those times that hit<br><br>

    Somehow my mind is at ease<br>
    Even in the dark, it's found peace<br>
    And I realize it's not always bad<br>
    To visit the past, it's just hard<br><br>

    To recover, to regain our consciousness<br>
    To maintain that steeze with ferociousness<br>
    Sometimes we fail to rush back from that scene<br>
    That left us crestfallen and at sea<br><br>

    But what can you really do?<br>

          You know when you left, I was forlorn<br>
          And at that moment, I understood the world no more<br><br>

    Now, your empty chair, brings a silent sigh<br>
    Could you not have lingered a while?<br>
    You weren't just a worker in the office halls<br>
    You were a voice for those who had no voice at all<br>
    You fought for fairness, for a decent wage<br>
    For a safe workplace, for a life on the page<br>
    You'd listen to people's stories, with a patient ear<br>
    And strive for what was right, without a single fear<br>
    Your diligence never went unseen<br>
    And we silently hoped that it would appear on screen<br>
    You always knew the right words to say<br>
    In times of need, your Solomon side came to play<br>
    You'd see the silent struggles and burdens others bear<br>
    And offer help to them, with a love so rare<br>
    We're rendered speechless! Are you really gone? Our friend so dear?<br>
    All we ever say, we truly wish you could hear<br>
    Now your laughter is gone, your presence we miss<br>
    But your imprint lives on, a gentle kiss<br>
    We comfort ourselves that you've found a safe haven<br>
    You're at a better place, with our Father in Heaven<br>
    So let's wipe our tears as we sing his grace<br>
    And remember the man, with a smile on our face<br>
    We wish you a goodnight, Francis<br>

    except it forgot to lift the memories over the bar<br>
    so unconventionally, I found myself back there<br>
    smiling at the echoes that came bare<br><br>

    that was five years ago<br>
    you became a story I used to know<br><br>

    then I saw you again<br>
    older, taller, a familiar frame<br>
    and so was I ... a lovelier dame<br>
    though the years had brushed us both<br>
    that glance, that pause ... it still spoke<br><br>

    there I stood in my spot, and you in yours<br>
    our hearts recalling what words ignored<br>
    feelings of the past returning in cuffs<br>
    slipping softly into the present, warmly enough<br><br>

    though we’ve changed and time has passed<br>
    some moments , like glances , are meant to last.<br><br>

    Hello Childhood
  </h3>

  <p id="poemText8" class="text-white text-sm leading-relaxed">
    Hello Childhood,<br>
    It's me.<br>
    I thought I'd never see you again.<br>
    But here you are - watching as I crawl in pain...

    It's insane, the same way I escaped, I return to be saved by you dear Childhood.<br>
    Tell you what, it was all in vain, the journey I took, there was no gain. No rain. Only stains.<br>
    So I'm back for my chains because my brain says it plain it can't sustain.<br>
    And I can't complain so I live restrained.<br>
    I'm back -<br>
    Because there, I did explain but what they obtained left me in pain so if I maintain I'm sure I'll get detained.<br>
    I'm so drained...<br>
    So I slip back into your skin, the one that never fit. The one stitched tight with silence.<br>
    Tongue heavy, heart locked<br>
    Mind hazy, head cocked<br>
    I remember your lessons;<br>
    1. Don't speak — You'll look like a freak, just freeze and enjoy the breeze.<br>
    2. Don't fight — Be out of sight. Don't shine too bright. Just enjoy your night.<br>
    3. Let them step over you, no need to feel blue. Pretend you've no clue. Pretend you're stone, bold, cold. Pretend you feel nothing...by laughing.<br>
    And I obey again because the disdain I've been trained with still remains.<br>
    I obey again, because survival there is smaller than breathing.<br>
    It's similar to bleeding, Thinner than a whisper, Better than a twister.<br>
    Hello Childhood,<br>
    I hate how familiar you are.<br>
    I hate that I still know your rules by heart.<br>
    But there in that place<br>
    You're the only version of me that has space.<br><br>

    There are some things we must ban<br>
    Just take a look at the sun<br>
    Look at how He sent us His son<br>
    Who can compare to this Man?<br>
    No one. No, none.<br>
    Sometimes I observe the world and gasp<br>
    I just get chills, my hands get clasped<br>
    Even at our worst He does His best<br>
    As sinful as we are, He gives us rest...<br><br>
    What could we ever give to Him? <br>
If not His songs, praises and Hymns?<br>


We Need The Man<br>
Let's admit it, He's the one<br>
Our ever loyal and loving friend<br>
The only true friend who doesn't pretend<br>
What is the world without His love?<br>
What would we be? What would we have?<br>
Tell me if not for His grace<br>
The grace that sees us through our race<br>
And helps us to set our pace<br>
And reveals to us His handsome face? <br>
Scream it, where would we be?<br>
Would the boss still be the boss?<br>
Would we sell and face no loss?<br>
Could we still carry our own cross?<br>
Would our laid-out plans ever sauce?<br>
Tell me, wouldn't we be on the knee?<br>
Pleading and screaming to break free????<br>


We Need The Lamb<br>
Trust me,He does no harm<br>
His plans work out like charm<br>
He even has the King's heart in His palm<br>
Would you rather not tend to Him and be calm?<br>
Do you prefer to have sin in your arm?<br>


We Need The King,just sit and think<br>
You know He's got all the links<br>
And can make your life brighter than pink<br>
Oh yes! It is to Him we sing<br>
Our merciful and loving father<br>
Our saviour who sends our troubles farther<br>
Come to Him you who think your life is harder<br>
And you'll be amazed how He'll work it out like a mother<br>


We Need Him,<br>
The Eternal<br>
Let's choose Him<br>
And flee infernal<br>

    I'm wandering...<br>
    In dream land <br>
    I see him...<br>
    I smile ...<br>
    I'm ecstatic ...<br>
    He is too....<br>
    I'm smiling...too much<br>
His gaze is bold, with a dare in its stare<br>
It leaves me trembling, with a heart that's willing to dare<br>
He takes my hand in his...<br>
Caresses it gently...<br>
Looks at me in the eye....<br>
I'm smiling.... Enchanted...<br>
We take a step together.....<br>
I turn again...my Bible falls...<br>
My eyes flutter open.....<br>
I wake up....<br>
It's a dream....<br>
My heart is beating <br>
I feel the heat, it's a rhythmic greeting <br>
I shut my eyes.... can't be happening <br>
In disbelief, my world is collapsing <br>
I see what it's doing, my heart <br>
And I hate to love it , it's tearing me apart <br>
I want to stop it, these irregular heartbeats<br>
That I only feel when he's around me<br>
But how can I when I can't seem to erase<br> 
The feeling of his gentle touch, his warm embrace<br>
How can I let go, when all I see is him, the moment I close my eyes <br>
How can I be free when his heart is where my heart lies<br>
I know what I'm doing<br>
I know it, I'm fooling <br>
But I've never been more happy to be a fool<br>
And loving him is a mistake I'd repeat as a rule <br>
I'm walking on thin ice <br>
My heart , a fragile device<br>
